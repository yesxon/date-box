Example gist: https://gist.github.com/kf-liu/7de2a55824ec5e8a78ebc3c57e4ca82b

## Setup
### Prep work
1. Create a new public GitHub Gist (https://gist.github.com)
2. Create a token with the `gist` scope and **copy it**. (https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)

### Github action only
You can use it directly in github action of an existing repository without cloning a new repository. Here's how to use it in a `.yml` file in `.github/workflows` directory.
```
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@master
  - name: Update gist
    uses: kf-liu/date-box@master
    env:
      TYPE: DAY  
      GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}
      GIST_ID: 7de2a55824ec5e8a78ebc3c57e4ca82b
      RECORDS: "0 * * * 0,6 _ WEEKEND | 0 0 10 * * _PAYDAY | 2022-10-22 _ INIT DATE-BOX | 0 * 28 12 * _ MY BIRTHDAY"
```
`env` is configured in the same way as below (Project setup).

### Project setup
You can also use and modify it in a new repository. Here's how to use it.

1. Fork this repo
1. Edit the [environment variable](https://github.com/kf-liu/date-box/blob/master/.github/workflows/schedule.yml#L18-L20) in `.github/workflows/schedule.yml`:

   - **GIST_ID:** The ID portion from your gist url: `https://gist.github.com/kf-liu/`**`7de2a55824ec5e8a78ebc3c57e4ca82b`**.
   - **RECORDS:** Your anniversary and countdown days. (The format is below. (Records format))

1. Go to the repo **Settings > Secrets**
1. Add the following environment variables:
   - **GH_TOKEN:** The GitHub token generated above.

## Records format
```
((cron|moment)( _ (event))? | )|*(cron|moment)( _ (event))?
    |     |     |     |     |
    |     |     |     |     |
    |     |     |     |     +- - - ' | ': record separator
    |     |     |     |
    |     |     |     +- - - - - - (event): what you want to record
    |     |     |
    |     |     +- - - - - - - - - ' _ ': the time and event separator
    |     |
    +- - -+- - - - - - - - - - - - (time): when you want to record
```
### Time format
Currently, two formats are supported: `cron` (for loop event) and `moment` (for single event).

- corn: to schedule a loop event to countdown at specific UTC times using [POSIX cron syntax](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/crontab.html#tag_20_25_07). 
  - e.g. 
    - `0 0 1 * *` For the first of every month
    - `0 0 l * *` For the last of every month
    - `0 0 * * 0` For every Sunday (00:00 am)
    - `0 * * * 0` For every Sunday (all day long)
- moment: to schedule a single event to countdown using [moment](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/string/). 
  - e.g. 
    - `2022-10-22`

### One record
One `record` consists of one `time` and one `event`, and thay are connected by ` _ ` (a space, an underscore, and a space). Each record will be displayed as a line in your gist.

e.g.
- `0 * * * 0,6 _ WEEKEND`
- `0 0 10 * * _ PAYDAY`
- `2022-10-22 _ CREATE DATE-BOX`
- `0 * 28 12 * _ MY BIRTHDAY`

Of course, `event` is not required, you can just give the time. (` _ ` is not required as well). 

### Multiple records
This is the final format of records: Connect a series of records with ` | ` (a space, an vertical bar, and a space).

e.g.
`0 * * * 0,6 _ WEEKEND | 0 0 10 * * _ PAYDAY | 2022-10-22 _ CREATE DATE-BOX | 0 * 28 12 * _ MY BIRTHDAY`.

## Ideas to be continue
- [ ] The countdown to the next holiday.
